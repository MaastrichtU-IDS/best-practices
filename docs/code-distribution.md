## Use git

Versioning your code using git is mandatory. Use git to commit even the smallest changes with a comment. Learn how to use branches and pull requests for bug fixes and the development of new features.

If you are developing code related to the Institute of Data Science we recommend you to create the repository in the MaastrichtU-IDS organization on GitHub: [https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS)

Some projects in collaboration with other entities can be hosted on GitLab depending on the requirements and project stack

## Add a license

Adding a license is mandatory as no one is allowed to legally use your code if no license is included. 

## Add DOAP project description

Optional: add a  DOAP (https://github.com/ewilderj/doap/wiki https://projects.apache.org/doap.html) file to the root of the repository.
