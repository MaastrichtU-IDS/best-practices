## Use git

Versioning your code using [git](https://git-scm.com/) is mandatory. Use `git` to commit even the smallest changes with a comment. Learn how to use branches and pull requests for bug fixes and the development of new features.

If you are developing code related to the Institute of Data Science, we recommend you to create the repository in the MaastrichtU-IDS organization on GitHub: [https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS)

> See [how to define user access](/docs/project-management) to your repository when created in the [MaastrichtU-IDS GitHub organization](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS).

Some projects in collaboration with other entities can be hosted on GitLab depending on the requirements and project stack. You can use the [UM-hosted GitLab](https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) for private projects.
