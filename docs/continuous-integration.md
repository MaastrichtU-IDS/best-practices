See our [IDS CI/CD workshop](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/workshop-ci/) to package and define Continuous Integration workflow for Python with GitHub Actions.

The choice of CI/CD technology depends on the platform you are using to store your code

* GitHub Actions
  * Recommended if your code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com)
* GitLab CI
  * Recommended if your code is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).
  * We recommend to use [GitLab hosted at UM](https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl) if possible.
* [Drone.io](https://drone.io/) (now [Harness](https://harness.io/))
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
* [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
