title: IDS Dashboard
---

We have realized the importance of applying FAIR principles to software.  At the IDS we have created the IDS Dashboard to improve findability and reproducibility of the software that we create in IDS projects.

The idea of IDS Dashboard is to provide a user-friendly interface, easily accessible to find and browse IDS projects, using a machine-readable ontology.

### What is the IDS Dashboard?

A website for projects at the [Institute of Data Science](http://maastrichtuniversity.nl/ids/) at Maastricht University. It is designed to help you find specific projects that meet your interests and to gain a broader understanding of the wide variety of work currently underway in the IDS.

### IDS Dashboard Architecture

A web UI in React with TypeScript which retrieves projects information from the SPARQL endpoint and releases info from the JSON file on GitHub. You will find specific information [here]( https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/projects#get-data-from-github-graphql-api):

### Improving the findability of IDS's Project

Human and machine visitors will like our IDS Dashboard since we presents relevant information in a incisive manner. Visitors will be able to quickly find a IDS project that is interesting them while providing machines with the relevant information about the project.  Consequently, we have made use of an ontology called Description of a project (DOAP) to help describe the metadata of a project in a way that machine can understand it. This is accomplished by including a simple file inside your Github repository project. The file is easily findable to humans, and machine can determine the project's status by searching for a string matching a specific pattern in a set of possible files.

### What is an IDS project?

An IDS project is a  publicly available code repository concerning IDS in varying state of usability, development and support. A IDS can typically be classified in the following table:

| üóÇÔ∏è Type of IDS project |                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üß™ Research            | A folder that contains all your "Research" related project's file |
| üë®‚Äçüíª Development        | A folder that contains all your "Development" related project's file |
| üéì  Education          | A folder that contains all your "Education" related project's file |


### What IDS Project should be added in IDS Dashboard?

As a rule of thumb, a project should be added to the IDS Dashboard if:

1. the project is no private,
2. we can realistically claim (co-)ownership of the project AND
3. the project could be useful to somebody else.

Under this definition, the following is not recorded in the IDS Dashboard:

- A script that was just meant to wrangle some data unique to a problem we were having (violates 3).
- A package that is very useful but that IDS wasn't involved with (violates 2).

The project can be stored either at MaastrichtU-IDS organization or your personal [GitHub](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&type=&language=) repository.


### How do I add a new IDS Project?

1. Go to the [IDS Project Dashboard website](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/projects/).
2. In the left pane,  click on [Create a DOAP description for your project](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/projects/create-doap).
3. You should now see a form. Each field has a brief explanation of what you should fill in.
4. Complete the form. Don't worry about mistakes, you can always come back later and fix it!
5. Don't forget to click ``Download DOAP description file`` when you 're done.

### Add a IDS project from your personal Github repository

IDS projects that are stored at your personal Github can be also added to IDS Dashboard. To do so, we request the following information to add into our [External Repository database](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/projects/blob/main/EXTERNAL_REPOSITORIES.txt):

1. user name.
2. repository name.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/projects/issues) if it is hosted under a different name, we will add it to the list of external repositories.


### How/When do I get to see my IDS Project?

Your project to the IDS Dashboard do not show up immediately. The length of delay depends on the frequency at which data is harvested from the GitHub GraphQL API.
