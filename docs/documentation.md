## Fill the README

Minimal requirements for the documentation is to fill the README.md at the root of the git repository with the informations required to run the software:

* Short description of the tool (2 to 3 lines will not kill anyone)
* How to install locally
  * e.g. `pip install my_package`
* Provide a few working examples to run
  * I should copy paste the provided example (almost)
  * If necessary, use sample files stored in the git repository (so everything is in the repo)
  * How many features do your program have? It should not be hard to cover most of them in 3 to 4 examples + generic mechanism
  * Try to keep those examples up-to-date
* How to build/run/stop/update with Docker
  * Should be only `docker-compose up -d`
  * But think to add details on running the code with Docker

>  Add **Wiki pages** on GitHub for additional documentation
