## Findable 🔎

The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data  should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the [FAIRification process](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/).

* [**F1**. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fair-data-principles-explained/f1-meta-data-assigned-globally-unique-persistent-identifiers/)

* [**F2**. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fair-data-principles-explained/f2-data-described-rich-metadata/)

* [**F3**. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f3-metadata-clearly-explicitly-include-identifier-data-describe/)

* [**F4**. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f4-metadata-registered-indexed-searchable-resource/)

## Accessible 📂

Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can  they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

* [**A1**. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/542-2/)
  * [**A1.1** The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-1-protocol-open-free-universally-implementable/)
  * [**A1.2** The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-2-protocol-allows-authentication-authorisation-required/)

* [**A2**. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a2-metadata-accessible-even-data-no-longer-available/)

## Interoperable ⚙️

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition,  the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for  analysis, storage, and processing.

* [**I1**. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i1-metadata-use-formal-accessible-shared-broadly-applicable-language-knowledge-representation/)

* [**I2**. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i2-metadata-use-vocabularies-follow-fair-principles/)

* [**I3**. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-metadata/)

## Reusable ♻️

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve  this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be  replicated and/or combined in different settings.

* [**R1**. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-metadata-richly-described-plurality-accurate-relevant-attributes/)
  * [**R1.1**. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-1-metadata-released-clear-accessible-data-usage-license/)
  * [**R1.2**. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-2-metadata-associated-detailed-provenance/)
  * [**R1.3**. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-3-metadata-meet-domain-relevant-community-standards/)

> The principles refer to three types of entities: data (or any digital  object), metadata (information about that digital object), and  infrastructure. For instance, principle F4 defines that both metadata  and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource (the  infrastructure component).
