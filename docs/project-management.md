## User management

Platform such as GitHub and GitLab enable you to provide different users with different access to your code repository.

### GitHub user management

Go to your repository `Settings`, then `User management`. You can then add the users with the access you want (read, edit, admin)

> For repositories in the [MaastrichtU-IDS organization](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS) you can give access to groups of users in the organization, such as `ids` for all members of IDS, or `developers` for the IDS developer team. You can also create new group of users for specific projects.

## Use issue boards

* See the GitHub issue board for the MaastrichtU-IDS organization: https://github.com/orgs/MaastrichtU-IDS/projects/4

Enable to keep track of issues in multiple repositories in the MaastrichtU-IDS organization

* Issue board available on GitLab too for projects and organizations (multiple projects).


## Create a Gitter chat room

[Gitter](https://gitter.im/) is a service from GitLab which allows to easily create and use public and private chatrooms linked to GitHub repositories. Users can easily connect using their GitHub or GitLab account.

* Login to Gitter using your GitHub account
* Create a room linked to your GitHub/GitLab repository (e.g. https://gitter.im/um-dsri/data2services)
