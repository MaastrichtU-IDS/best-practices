## On your machine

### Installed locally

Better for development, to use development and debug environments.

### Using Docker

Better when just running an application without doing development, or when running in production on a server.

## On the DSRI

The [Data Science Research Infrastructure](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation) at Maastricht University provides CPU and GPUs nodes for Data Science computing, requires a [VPN connection to the UM network](https://vpn.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

## On Google Collab

Run [Jupyter Notebooks on Google](https://colab.research.google.com/) servers for research.

## On Kaggle

To run Jupyter Notebooks when participating to a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) Data Science competition.

> Free during the competition.

## Using CI/CD solutions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) to run workflows on their servers triggered by event such as `git push`, new release, new pull request...
