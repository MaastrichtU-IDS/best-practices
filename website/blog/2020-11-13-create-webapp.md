This web page will help you quickly create a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) web application using TypeScript in a few minute.

## Create your website

Requirements: `npm` and `Yarn` installed

Checkout the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.io/guides/typescript/) for the complete up-to-date documentation.

Install command line packages globally:

```bash
yarn global add expo-cli create-react-native-app
```

Create your project from the default TypeScript template:

```bash
expo init -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```

> You can also create your project using one of the available [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app) template:
>
> ```bash
> create-react-native-app my-project
> ```

Once your projects has been generated, go in its folder:

```bash
cd my-project
```

Start the application on http://localhost:19006

```bash
yarn web
```

> If it worked, you can now make changes to `App.tsx` to start your application!

## Improve your website

### Recommended UI libraries

Various libraries are available to design your UI, if you don't know which one to pick we recommend the following:

* UI Kitten for native applications: https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten
* Material UI for web applications: https://material-ui.com

### Add a CSS file

It can be useful to define global CSS styles:

1. Create a `App.css` file. Here to import a font and define default body text alignment to the center:

   ```css
   @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans");
   body {
     text-align: center; 
   } 
   ```

2. Import the CSS file in `App.tsx`:

   ```typescript
   import './App.css';
   ```

### Add multiple page

Add a router to be able to have more than one page.

## Build a SOLID app

Build a SOLID app with React using [SOLID React Components](https://solid.github.io/react-components).

> You can also [query SOLID data with Tripledoc](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/building-a-solid-app-in-react-with-tripledoc-27fd47d8bdda).

### Add SOLID login

1. Add SOLID for React npm package to your project:

```bash
yarn add @solid/react
```

2. Add the login/logout button to your navigation bar:

```typescript
import { AuthButton } from '@solid/react';

<AuthButton popup="https://inrupt.net/common/popup.html"/>
```

### Use SOLID user data

Show the user name if logged in with SOLID:

```typescript
import { LoggedIn, LoggedOut, Value } from '@solid/react';

<LoggedIn>
  <p>
    Welcome <Value src="user.name"/>!
  </p>
</LoggedIn>
<LoggedOut>
  <p>
    Please login with SOLID
  </p>
</LoggedOut>
```

## Deploy your website

We recommend to deploy for free on GitHub Pages. If your application need to run NodeJS on the server then contact us to deploy on IDS servers.

### On GitHub Pages

We recommend you to deploy your React applications as a static websites for free on GitHub Pages. 

> You can also use a custom URL with GitHub Pages if you don't want to use the default github.io URL. This can be easily defined in your GitHub repository settings.

Install `gh-pages`:

```bash
yarn add gh-pages --dev
```

Add GitHub Pages scripts to deploy to GitHub Pages in `package.json` and provide the URL of the website on GitHub Page in `homepage`:

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "build": "expo build:web",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d web-build"
},
"homepage": "https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/my-github-repository",
```

Make sure the base path is properly set in your application if the GitHub Page is deployed on a specific path (e.g. https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/my-github-repository/):

```typescript
<Router basename="/my-github-repository/">
```

> Then use `<Link to="/">` to link within the app (instead of `<a href>`).

Deploy to GitHub Pages from your terminal:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

You can automate this process at each push to the `main` branch by creating the file `.github/workflows/deploy-github.yml` with this content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: 12
    - name: Install dependencies and build
      run: |
        git config --global user.email "MY.EMAIL@maastrichtuniversity.nl"
        git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
        yarn install
        yarn build
    - name: Deploy on GitHub
      uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.7.1
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        BRANCH: gh-pages
        FOLDER: web-build
        CLEAN: true
```

### On IDS servers with Docker

Define the scripts to build and serve for production in `package.json`

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "build": "expo build:web",
    "serve": "serve -s web-build"
}
```

Define a simple `Dockerfile` to install your application, and serve it in production mode:

```dockerfile
FROM node:12-alpine
WORKDIR /webapp

# Only install NPM packages if package.json or yarn.lock change
COPY package.json package.json
COPY yarn.lock yarn.lock
RUN yarn install

COPY . .
# Build in /web-build folder
RUN yarn build

EXPOSE 5000
ENTRYPOINT [ "yarn", "serve" ]
```

Copy your `.gitignore` and rename the copy to `.dockerignore` to avoid conflict with Docker and your local environment:

```bash
cp .gitignore .dockerignore
```

Once the Docker configuration has be done, you can build it:

```bash
docker build -t my-project .
```

And try starting the application on http://localhost:5000

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 my-project
```

> When this has be done, contact us to run your Docker image on IDS servers.
