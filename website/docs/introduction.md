The best-practices page is a collection of introductory information and guidelines geared towards data scientists looking to improve their development practices. Following the recommendations given here will result in research and development that is easier to reproduce, transfer to other usecases and collaborate on. The recommendations here can be seen as a first step to improving your process, and best practices to follow in absence of better alternatives. These best practices are developed by the [Institute of Data Science](https://maastrichtuniversity.nl/ids) at Maastricht University.
