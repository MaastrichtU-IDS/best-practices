## Create a code repository

When starting a Data Science project you need to create a repository on a platform to host your project's code. 

Today a lot of solutions exist, most of them are based on [git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), and they provide various features beside code hosting, such as reporting issues, running automated workflows, publishing documentation, and websites.

:::tip GitHub for open source

The Institute of Data Science mainly uses its [MaastrichtU-IDS GitHub organization](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS), hence we recommend to use GitHub for projects related to IDS.

:::caution GitLab for private

Some projects in collaboration with other organizations can be hosted on GitLab depending on the project requirements. You can use the [UM-hosted GitLab](https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) for private projects.

### Issues and boards

Using issues is a great way to keep track of feedbacks, bugs and improvements to do to your project. We encourage you to use them as much as possible.

You can order issues in issues boards, either for a single repository or across multiple repositories.

* See the GitHub issue board for the MaastrichtU-IDS organization: https://github.com/orgs/MaastrichtU-IDS/projects/4

* Issue boards are available on GitLab too for projects and organizations (multiple projects).

### User management

Code-hosting platforms enable to define different user access to your code repository.

On GitHub, go to your repository **Settings**, then **User management**. You can then add the users with the access you want (`read`, `edit`, `admin`)

:::info Manage IDS GitHub users

For repositories in the [MaastrichtU-IDS organization](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS) you can give access to groups of users in the organization, such as `ids` for all members of IDS, or `developers` for the IDS developer team. 

You can also create new group of users for specific projects.

## Create a Gitter chat room

Additionally, for some projects you might need a public chat channel.

[Gitter](https://gitter.im/) is a service from GitLab which allows to easily create and use public and private chatrooms linked to GitHub repositories. 

:::tip Connect with GitHub

Users can easily connect using their [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) account.
